Rock Paper Scissors

This project was a quick introduction into javascript.

The concept was a Rock, paper, scissors game with the player being "prompted" to select a choice out of the 3 and it would return a win or loss depending on what the computer decided to choose. I formulated the computer choice to be absolutely random so it's a fair 33.33% chance for each option.

I included a small score board and each session lasts until either the player or the computer reaches 3 wins.
